        This is the whiteboard the final version of my merge lists method is based off of.

        This is an earlier version of the whiteboard, created with Dana Voros, which does not meet the On space requirement
        of the challenge. Ultimately this was refactored via a second whiteboard and some adjustments while coding it out.
