# Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
This lab required three different classes, a Binary Tree class, a Binary Search Tree class, and a Node class. 
- The Binary Tree class needed to implement the three depth first traversals, preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder. 
- The Binary Search Tree class needed to implement methods for adding a node, and checking to see if a value was stored 
    in the tree. 
- The Node class needed to house the properties for the Value of each node, as well as the Right Child and the Left Child. 

Additionally, the tests had to cover and pass the following parameters: 

-  Successful instantiation of an empty tree.    
- Successful instantiation of a tree with a single root node. 
- Additions of left and right children onto a root node. 
- Returns the correct collections from each of the depth traversal methods. 

## Approach & Efficiency

I opted to house my three classes in a single
