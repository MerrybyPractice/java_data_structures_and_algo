# First-in, First out Animal Shelter.
This Animal Shelter utilizes the queue class in my Stacks and Queue's package and adds functionality to check the type of 
item being dequeued. 

## Challenge
Create a class that takes in Cats and Dogs. It needs to have an enqueue dequeue method, and be able to search the queue for 
a specific type of pet. 

## Approach & Efficiency
Time wise, worst case my dequeue will be On due to my while loop. Everything else should be O1. I opted to base the entire 
functionality on classes and checking class vs each other.
