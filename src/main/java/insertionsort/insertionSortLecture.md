# Insertion Sort Lecture 

## Materials 

1. enough playing cards for everyone in the class to have a hand of 5-7

## Procedure 

### Introduction (1-3 mins)

    Pass out the well shuffled playing cards face down at each sutdents desk.
    Once everyone is in and class begins, ask the class to pick up their hand of 
    cards and sort it, and put it back down on the table when they are done. 
    
### Basics of an insertion sort 
    
    Start off lecture with this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oJS1BMKE64 
    - insertion sorts are best suited for small arrays or in cases where a larger collection is almost sorted 
        - Time: O(n*2)
        - Space: O(1)
    - Write the Insertion sort Method on the white board while talking through it: 
        1. establish a sorted and unsorted portion of your array
        2. compare the first element in the unsorted section to the first element in the sorted section. 
            - if it is larger do nothing and move the sorted marker one further
            - if it is smaller, pull it from the collection and shift the elements in the sorted posotion until 
            you find its spot. Insert it there, and move the marker by one element. 
        3. return a fully sorted array! 
    - once you have the method written, collaboratively sort a collection of 5-7 items on the board with the class - 
    asking for feedback and next steps along the way. Ideally class will end up taking lead in this. 
    - Now refer back to the cards on their table and ask them to shuffle them. 
    - while they are shuffling, talk about how people often discuss insertion sort in refrence to sorting a hand of cards
        - depending on time here, also worth mentioning that it is considered an online sort, in that it can sort a 
        collection as it is recieved. 
    - once the shuffeling is finished ask them to sort their hands with an insertion sort method. 
        - ask how this was different from the first time they did it, any thing they noticed, how it was to follow and 
        keep track of the steps, and any questions that arose ect. 
        
### Optional 

    If the assignment for that evening is not to write an insertion sort, ask the class to pseudo one out with you on the 
    board. 
    
    If the assignemnt is to write one, close with one of the suppulmentary videos in the resources section.I reccomend the 
    romanian folk dance, however if the class would be better served by a slightly less whimsical take the geeks for geeks 
    is certinaly that.
