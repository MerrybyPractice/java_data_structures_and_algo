#hash package 

I find hashing and other cryptography concepts fascinating, so when starting my code challenge on the topic during Java 
401 I wanted to set up my package to be scalable and encourage further experimentation. Some of these will be repeated from
the general challenges ReadMe, however any that are personal experimentation and were not assigned will be unique to this 
document. Below is a list of the current files and their features: 

## [BasicHash](./src/main/java/hash/BasicHash.java) 

## [HashTable](./src/main/java/hash/Hashtable.java)
